# MSDSongRegression
Machine leraning project using MSD year-prediction dataset. Using Tenserflow and Numpy libraries of Python.

Problem Type: Regression
Used Libraries: Tensorflow, Numpy

This project uses modified MSD year-prediction based on YearPredictionMSD Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset originally has 90 features(12 timbre average data, 78 timbre covarianve data), but to make the problem more simple, in this project only 12 of them(timbre averate data) are used.
The purpose of this project is to predict the year the song was released with its timbre average data.
